# cronJobs
cron jobs for one of my servers that would be useful for me. Right now it'll be just rss emails but who knows 

## Use
1. git clone repo 
2. Add a email and password login, use app passwords if possible. Google provides app passwords. It might be a good idea to create a totally new email just for this sort of automated messaging
3. Compile
4. Add combiled task to cron job `/etc/cron`
